# Issue Classification

End-to-end procedure for reading a categories document, screening GitHub
issues, and producing classification decisions. The agent prompt defines
your role and constraints; this skill defines the process.

## Step 1: Load categories

Read the categories document from `CLASSIFY_CATEGORIES_PATH`. The harness
copies it into the sandbox as `/tmp/workspace/categories.md` when the path
is configured. Fall back through known locations, then the GitHub API:

```bash
CATEGORIES_PATH="${CLASSIFY_CATEGORIES_PATH:-categories.md}"

if [ -f "$CATEGORIES_PATH" ]; then
  cat "$CATEGORIES_PATH"
elif [ -f "/tmp/workspace/categories.md" ]; then
  cat "/tmp/workspace/categories.md"
elif [ -f "../$CATEGORIES_PATH" ]; then
  cat "../$CATEGORIES_PATH"
elif [ -f "target-repo/$CATEGORIES_PATH" ]; then
  cat "target-repo/$CATEGORIES_PATH"
else
  gh api "repos/$CLASSIFY_SOURCE_REPO/contents/$CATEGORIES_PATH" --jq '.content' | base64 -d
fi
```

**Stop if the document is empty or missing.** Do not proceed without
category descriptions — classification without context produces garbage.

Parse the **exact category names** from the document headings. These are
the only valid values for `workstream_category` in your output. Store
them for exact-match comparison later.

## Step 2: Build the candidate list

Check `CLASSIFY_MODE` and `CLASSIFY_ISSUE_NUMBER`:

- **If `CLASSIFY_MODE` is `single` and `CLASSIFY_ISSUE_NUMBER` is set:**
  Your candidate list is exactly ONE issue. Fetch only that issue:

  ```bash
  gh issue view "$CLASSIFY_ISSUE_NUMBER" --repo "$CLASSIFY_SOURCE_REPO" \
    --json number,title,body,labels,author,createdAt,comments
  ```

  **Skip the rest of Step 2 and Step 3 entirely.** Go directly to Step 4
  with this single issue as your only candidate.

- **Otherwise (batch modes `unclassified` or `all`):**

Fetch all open issues:

```bash
gh issue list --repo "$CLASSIFY_SOURCE_REPO" --state open \
  --json number,title,labels,author,createdAt --limit 5000
```

Then **exclude issues that are already classified** on the project
board. The pre-script identifies these on the host, but you are in a
sandbox and must discover them yourself. Query the project board to
find issues that already have a workstream category assigned:

```bash
ORG="${CLASSIFY_SOURCE_REPO%%/*}"
PROJECT_NUM="${CLASSIFY_PROJECT_NUMBER:-1}"
FIELD="${CLASSIFY_FIELD_NAME:-Workstream Category}"
TOKEN="${CLASSIFY_PROJECT_TOKEN:-$GH_TOKEN}"

CLASSIFIED=$(GH_TOKEN="$TOKEN" gh api graphql --paginate -f query='
  query($org: String!, $num: Int!, $fieldName: String!, $endCursor: String) {
    organization(login: $org) {
      projectV2(number: $num) {
        items(first: 100, after: $endCursor) {
          nodes {
            content { ... on Issue { number repository { nameWithOwner } } }
            fieldValueByName(name: $fieldName) {
              ... on ProjectV2ItemFieldSingleSelectValue { name }
            }
          }
          pageInfo { hasNextPage endCursor }
        }
      }
    }
  }' -f org="$ORG" -F num="$PROJECT_NUM" -f fieldName="$FIELD" \
  --jq '.data.organization.projectV2.items.nodes[]
    | select(.content.repository.nameWithOwner == env.CLASSIFY_SOURCE_REPO)
    | select(.fieldValueByName.name != null and .fieldValueByName.name != "")
    | .content.number' 2>/dev/null | sort -n || true)
```

If the project query fails (permissions, network), log a warning and
continue with the full issue list — the post-script will prevent
duplicate writes regardless.

Remove any issue whose number appears in `$CLASSIFIED` from your
candidate list. Only evaluate issues that are **not already classified**.

## Step 3: Screen candidates

Check `CLASSIFY_SCREEN_ISSUES` (defaults to `true`).

**If screening is enabled (`true`):** You have limited time. Do NOT call
`gh issue view` on every issue.

1. **Screen by title and labels.** Using the category descriptions from
   Step 1, identify which issues are plausible candidates that need deeper
   inspection. Skip issues whose titles clearly belong to other categories
   or are obviously off-topic.

2. **Apply category filter.** If `CLASSIFY_FILTER_CATEGORY` is set, only
   fetch details for issues that might belong in that specific category.

**If screening is disabled (`false`):** Fetch details for ALL candidate
issues from Step 2. Do not skip any based on title or labels.

**Fetch details and comments for each candidate:**

```bash
gh issue view <number> --repo "$CLASSIFY_SOURCE_REPO" \
  --json number,title,body,labels,author,createdAt,comments
```

The `comments` field returns `{author, body, createdAt}` objects.
Comments often contain critical context — decisions, scope changes,
clarifications, or re-framing that the original body lacks. For issues
with many comments, focus on the first few and last few (scope-setting
and most recent decisions).

You may batch multiple `gh issue view` calls to work efficiently.

## Step 4: Classify each candidate

For each issue you evaluate, compare the issue's title, body, comments,
labels, and context against the category descriptions. Consider:

- Descriptive sections and scope boundaries
- "What belongs here" guidance
- "What does NOT belong here" exclusions
- Signal keywords
- Comment discussion that may redefine the issue's scope
- Any classification decision guide or tiebreaker rules in the document

### Classification rules

1. **Category filter** — If `CLASSIFY_FILTER_CATEGORY` is set, you may
   only assign that exact category or `null`.

2. **Confidence threshold** — Only assign a category when your confidence
   meets `CLASSIFY_MIN_CONFIDENCE` (default 0.7). Prefer `null` over a guess.

3. **Mutual exclusivity** — One category or null per issue. Never multiple.

4. **Respect exclusion lists** — If a category explicitly excludes the
   issue's topic, do not assign it.

5. **Labels are signal, not definitive** — Always read issue content.

6. **When in doubt, don't classify** — Ambiguous → `null` with reasoning.

7. **Category names must be exact** — Use the exact strings from the
   categories document. Do not paraphrase or abbreviate.

## Step 5: Write output

Write `${FULLSEND_OUTPUT_DIR}/agent-result.json`. Only include issues
you actually evaluated. The top-level key **must** be `"issues"`.

```bash
mkdir -p "${FULLSEND_OUTPUT_DIR}"
cat > "${FULLSEND_OUTPUT_DIR}/agent-result.json" << 'AGENT_RESULT_EOF'
{
  "issues": [
    {
      "issue_number": 42,
      "workstream_category": "Bug fixes",
      "reasoning": "Issue reports a crash in the login flow.",
      "confidence": 0.92
    }
  ]
}
AGENT_RESULT_EOF
```

### Output fields (each object in the `"issues"` array)

- `issue_number`: integer
- `workstream_category`: exact category name string or `null`
- `reasoning`: 1-3 sentences (max 2000 chars)
- `confidence`: float 0.0–1.0

Prioritize producing output over exhaustive analysis. If time is limited,
classify what you have and write the file.
